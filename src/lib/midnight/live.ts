// Nightjar — the live path: a real wallet, a real contract, a real proof.
//
// Everything else in `lib/midnight` is either demo-safe or type-only. This is
// the one entry point that pulls in the ledger and onchain-runtime WASM, so it
// loads them lazily: a browser that only wants the demo never fetches them, and
// the cost is paid the first time someone actually goes on-chain.
//
// Usage, once a wallet is connected:
//
//   const client = await connectMarket({ api, address, persona, config });
//   const { contractAddress } = await client.deploy(arbiterSecret, onProgress);
//   // ...or join one someone else deployed:
//   //   const client = await connectMarket({ api, address, persona, config, contractAddress });
//   await client.stakeBond(20_000n, onProgress);
//
// Requires `npm run compact` (for the contract bindings and keys) and
// `npm run sync:zk` (to serve them), plus a wallet on the same network as
// `config.networkId`.
