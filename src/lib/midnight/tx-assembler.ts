// agent-commerce — transaction assembly (plan.md §3, the last seam).
//
// Turns a circuit call into an unproven ledger transaction, using the same
// compiled contract the test suite runs (`@agent-commerce/contracts`) so the
// two cannot drift.
//
// This module is the *only* one that touches the ledger and onchain-runtime
// WASM, and it is deliberately kept out of `index.ts`. The in-process demo
// never imports it, so a browser that only wants the walkthrough never pays for
// the runtime.
//
// The pipeline, and who does which part:
//
//   1. Read the deployed contract state from the indexer (us).
//   2. Run the circuit locally against that state, producing a call trace —
//      public transcript, private transcript, input, output (compact-runtime).
//   3. Partition the transcript into guaranteed/fallible segments, build a
//      `ContractCallPrototype`, wrap it in an `Intent`, and assemble an
//      unproven `Transaction` (midnight-js-contracts). This is the part worth
//      taking from the library: the partitioning has to be byte-exact with what
//      the chain will re-derive, and the key location has to embed the deployed
//      verifier key's hash.
//   4. Prove it — delegated to the *wallet* via the connector's
//      `getProvingProvider`, not to a standalone proof server.
//   5. Balance, pay DUST fees, submit (the wallet again; see `submit.ts`).
//
// Step 4 is why this does not use `midnight-js`'s own `submitCallTx`: that path
// proves through a `ProofProvider` pointed at a proof server, whereas a
// connector-based DApp should let the wallet prove, so the user's keys and
// proving preferences stay in the wallet.
